# ObjectModelisation
Comprehensive C++ OOP project

Doing this project again because it covers the most essential notions of C++ so it's good exercising.

The aim of this project is to display logic gates using Qt6.

Notions covered: 
- friend classes
- data structures : vectors, maps, lists
- netlists
- cast, static_cast
- overload
- forward declarations, #pragma_once
- xml parser
- pointers and references

**update 29/06**
